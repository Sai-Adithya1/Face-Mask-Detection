# Face-Mask-Detection
# 😷 Face Mask Detection Using Deep Learning

This project is a deep learning-based solution to detect whether people are wearing face masks. It uses Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and the MobileNetV2 architecture to perform real-time face mask detection on images and webcam video.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time detection using webcam
- Face classification as **"Mask"** or **"No Mask"**
- Lightweight model using MobileNetV2 for speed and efficiency
- Can be trained on custom datasets
- Easily extendable for CCTV/video input
